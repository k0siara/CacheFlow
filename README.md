[![Android CI](https://github.com/k0siara/CacheFlow/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/k0siara/CacheFlow/actions/workflows/android.yml) [![](https://jitpack.io/v/k0siara/cacheflow.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#k0siara/cacheflow)

## How to include in your project

Add `jitpack` repository to your project root `build.gradle` (or `build.gradle.kts`)

``` groovy
// build.gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
    // ...
}
```

For newer projects (Gradle above 6.8), you need to also update the `settings.gradle` file's `dependencyResolutionManagement` block

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }  // <--
        jcenter() // Warning: this repository is going to shut down soon
    }
}
```

Add the dependency to your module's `build.gradle` (or `build.gradle.kts`)

``` groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.k0siara:cacheflow:<version>'
}

```
